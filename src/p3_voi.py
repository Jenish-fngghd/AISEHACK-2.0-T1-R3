"""T23 / P3-21: what did each of the six acquisitions actually buy?

We were GIVEN six Capella scenes and we used all six. Nobody ever asked what any one
of them contributed. That is a strange gap, because the honest answer changes what we
can claim: if the shipped ranking is recoverable from one date, then the trajectory
machinery -- growth, persistence, senescence, the whole reason a time series was
acquired -- is decoration, and "we tracked the crop through the season" is a sentence
we are not entitled to say.

Three questions, none of them asked before:

  Q1  LEAVE-ONE-DATE-OUT. Rebuild the index without each date in turn. How far does the
      within-crop ranking move, and how many farms leave the bottom-decile attention list?

  Q2  HOW MANY SCENES DO WE ACTUALLY NEED? Greedy forward selection over dates, scoring
      each subset by how well it reproduces the shipped within-crop ranking. If two dates
      reach 95%, four of the six bought nothing measurable.

  Q3  DOES THE INDEX USE TIME AT ALL? Permute which physical date sits in which slot and
      rebuild. Growth, persistence and senescence are all defined by ordering, so a
      correctly built index MUST move. If the permuted index still matches the shipped one,
      we never used the time axis and the six dates were six looks at one thing.

CONTROLS:

  C1  ★ THE HARNESS TEST, AND IT HAS A KNOWN ANSWER. 29 October is already excluded from
      the primary index -- LEVEL_DATES drops it and, with use_29oct False, it enters no
      part, not even the integral. So leave-one-date-out on 29 October must return a
      ranking IDENTICAL to the shipped one: Spearman exactly 1.000, zero farms moved.
      Any other result means the harness is wrong and every number it produces is void.
      This check runs first and aborts the run if it fails.

  C2  The permutation in Q3 must demonstrably scramble the temporal parts. If growth,
      persist and senesce come back unchanged under a shuffled calendar, the test never
      tested anything and Q3's answer must be discarded rather than reported.

  C3  Invariance. The modifier renormalises within crop, so every variant returns the same
      village total by construction. Asserted, not assumed -- a variant that moves the
      total would mean the renormalisation broke.

This file NEVER imports into the shipped path and never rewrites a deliverable. It reads
p1_farm_features.csv and submission.csv and writes its own tables.

Writes results/tables/p3_voi_lodo.csv, p3_voi_greedy.csv, p3_voi_stats.csv.
