"""T21: is Sokhda TYPICAL of the district whose yield statistic we borrow?

★ THE UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTION UNDER OUR DOMINANT UNCERTAINTY.

The anchor is a Vadodara DISTRICT statistic applied to ONE VILLAGE, and it carries 385.2 t of
the village-total interval -- more than everything else combined. T19's climatology tested the
YEAR adjustment (was 2025 ordinary at Sokhda? yes, z = -0.16). It never touched the assumption
underneath:

    village yield  ==  district average yield

Nobody asks this, and it is a directional error if wrong. A district average applied to a
village that is systematically poorer than its district OVERSTATES production, and no amount of
uncertainty widening fixes a bias -- it only hides it in a wider interval.

Radar can test it, because the comparison is RELATIVE and relative is the one thing X-band and
C-band can do without labels (section 4.1).

THE DESIGN, AND WHY IT IS BLOCK-MATCHED. Comparing Sokhda's mean to individual pixels in the
surrounding landscape would compare two different things -- a 447 ha average against 100 m^2
samples, whose spreads are not comparable. So the surrounding area is cut into blocks of
SOKHDA'S OWN SIZE (~2.1 km, ~450 ha), each block averaged over its CROPLAND pixels only
(ESA WorldCover 2021, class 40). Sokhda is then one draw from a distribution of like-sized,
like-land-use neighbours, and its PERCENTILE is a meaningful statement.

★ THE CONTROL THAT MAKES IT A FINDING RATHER THAN A NUMBER. One year's percentile could be
weather, noise, or a single bad scene. So the whole thing is repeated for every year 2017-2025.
If Sokhda's rank among its neighbours is STABLE across nine independent seasons, it is a
structural property of the village and it bears on the anchor. If the rank wanders, it is noise
and we say so and stop.

HONEST LIMIT, STATED UP FRONT: VH backscatter is a canopy-density proxy, not yield. A stable
offset is evidence of a systematic difference in canopy, which is suggestive about yield and not
equivalent to it. This is reported as a directional flag on the anchor, never as a correction.
