"""T16: recover the crop map from six labellings with NO ground truth (Dawid-Skene).

WHY THIS AND NOT MORE SAR WORK. Section 4.1 established that the imagery decides exactly two
things: the ORDERING of plots within a crop, and WHICH CROP each plot is. The ordering is already
validated against an independent same-day sensor at rho ~ 0.5 and cannot move the village total.
The crop map moves the village total by 236.5 t (P3-11), measured externally. So the crop map is
the only place where a better method changes the answer, and it is where this file works.

THE ASSET NOBODY HAS USED. Six teams labelled these same 966 farms in Round 2. The obvious move
is majority vote, which we already have and which gives 650.3 t. Majority vote assumes every
annotator is equally reliable and that their errors are independent -- both false here, and
demonstrably so: one team (Orion) produces a village total 25% above everyone else.

Dawid & Skene (1979) is the right tool and it fits this situation exactly: latent true labels,
several imperfect annotators, NO ground truth. EM jointly estimates

    pi[k]        the prevalence of each crop
    theta[j,k,l] annotator j's probability of SAYING l when the truth is k   (a confusion matrix
                 PER TEAM, estimated without ever seeing a true label)
    T[i,k]       the posterior over the true crop of farm i

An annotator that is systematically wrong is down-weighted automatically, and one that is wrong
in a *predictable* way still contributes information through the off-diagonal of its confusion
matrix -- which majority vote throws away entirely.

★ HOW WE AVOID GRADING OUR OWN HOMEWORK. A label set cannot be validated against the labels it
was derived from, and P1-5 proved every naive label test on this stack is circular. So the
referee here is the test already in the repo -- D4's non-circular residual method: regress the
independent S2 NDVI witness on the dominant SAR axis (PC1 of the six-date gamma0 series) that
produced the labels, then measure how much of the RESIDUAL each labelling explains. That test is
Orion's design, is already used to defend our shipped labels, and was fixed in the plan before
this file existed. We did not invent a metric for the occasion.

This file DECIDES NOTHING. It reports whether Dawid-Skene beats what we ship, on a pre-existing
test. Changing the crop map changes the deliverable, and that is a decision to be taken
deliberately, not as a side effect of an experiment.
