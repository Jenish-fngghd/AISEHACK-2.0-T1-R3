"""Phase 1.1: adjudicate the calibration convention on all six scenes.

The question. Capella ships `scale_factor`; the product is annotated `beta_nought`.
Round 1 and Round 2 used beta0 = SF * |z|^2. The capella-reader reference defines
beta0_complex = SF * DN, so POWER carries SF**2. ESA's note states a formula whose `sc`
is ambiguous and cannot settle it. Round 2's post-mortem settled it on the vendor's own
`nesz_peak` -- an absolute dB level Capella put in the product -- over four scenes, at
0.35 dB mean absolute error under SF**2 against 26-28 dB under SF.

The physics that makes nesz_peak an adjudicator: a scene contains smooth dark surfaces
(open water, quiet tarmac, dry smooth bare soil) whose return approaches the system
noise floor. The darkest percentiles must therefore sit NEAR the declared floor. Tens of
dB above it would mean the sensor never reaches its own noise anywhere in a 27 km strip,
which is not a thing a working SAR does.

WHAT IS NEW HERE, and it is the whole point: two scenes Round 2 never saw. If 29 Oct and
12 Nov behave like the four, SF**2 is confirmed on six scenes with six different scale
factors and six different declared floors, and the R2 defect is closed. If they do NOT,
that is a finding about those products -- not about the formula -- and it must be found
now, because both new dates are exactly the ones the forecast leans on.

KILL CRITERION, written before the run. Under SF**2, each new scene's |darkest-percentile
minus nesz_peak| must fall inside [min, max] of the four known scenes widened by 1.0 dB.
Outside that, the two new products are not radiometrically like the four and every
inter-date difference that spans the boundary is suspect until explained.

A SECOND TEST, added after the first run and reported alongside it, because the first
one turned out to be answerable in a way that changes what Round 2 concluded. The
darkest content in a scene sits AT OR ABOVE the noise floor, never below it: a negative
residual means the product's own darkest pixels are quieter than the noise the vendor
declares, which is not a thing that can happen. So the residual SIGN is a harder test
than its magnitude, and a small MAE bought by sitting below the floor is worse than a
larger one above it. Run it on all three quantities to find which one nesz_peak is
actually referenced to -- that is a question about the vendor's annotation, and only the
data can answer it.

Reads results/cache/{beta0,gamma0}_base_*.tif (written by p1_prep under SF**2).
Writes results/tables/p1_calibration.csv and results/figures/p1_calib_nesz.png.
