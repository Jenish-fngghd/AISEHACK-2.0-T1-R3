"""T19: can the radar say anything about the LEVEL? A nine-year climatology for this village.

★ THIS ATTACKS THE ONE THING WE SAID THE SAR CANNOT DO.

Section 4.1 concluded: the SAR decides the ORDERING of plots and WHICH CROP each is, and nothing
else -- the LEVEL comes from a published statistic, because X-band has no absolute yield
calibration without labels. That is true of a single season. It is NOT necessarily true across
seasons, and the difference is the whole idea here:

    absolute level        needs a label.   We do not have one.
    RELATIVE level        needs a HISTORY. Sentinel-1 has nine years over this village.

And the gap this lands in is documented and specific. In data_aux/anchors_r3.csv, FOUR OF FIVE
crops carry adj_2025_26 = 1.00 with the reason "no kharif 2025-26 anchor found ... held at base
and flagged". That 1.00 is not a measurement. It is an assumption that 2025 was an ordinary
year at Sokhda. A nine-year radar climatology can TEST that assumption for this exact village,
which no yield statistic published at district or state level can do.

WHY IT IS NEWLY POSSIBLE. Every Sentinel-1 scene over Sokhda between June and September, in
every year from 2016 to 2025, is on ONE track (descending, relative orbit 34). Nine years with
no look-side or incidence mixing. The confound that dominates multi-year SAR comparisons is
simply absent, by luck, and the run asserts it rather than trusting it.

★ THE CONTROL THAT DECIDES WHETHER ANY OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING. A multi-year radiometric
comparison can drift for reasons that have nothing to do with crops: sensor calibration, the
S1B failure in Dec 2021, processor baseline changes, or simply a wetter year. So every year is
measured TWICE over the same pixels, same scenes:

    FARM pixels      inside the 966 parcels          -- the signal
    NON-FARM pixels  everything else in the AOI      -- the control

If both move together, we are measuring the atmosphere, the soil or the sensor and the result is
void. Only a farm anomaly that the non-farm reference does NOT show can be about the crop. The
difference (farm - nonfarm) is the quantity to trust, and it is reported as such.

The window is 1 June - 30 September, deliberately ENDING BEFORE the 23-28 October rain disaster,
so this measures the growing season rather than the flood.
